# Chat-Client-and-Server
Creating a chat system using socket programming

The chat system uses a server where clients/users will communicate on. First users will register and create an username/id and password. Then the user will log into the system. The user can set nick names for themselves and can also send direct messages to other users on the server using the !X username command.
